## Gameplay

Beginning on the dealer’s left, each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.
When the card played to the center is a jack, the fun begins! The first player to slap their hand down on the jack takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile.

Double - If (two cards of the same number - such as two Aces, or two Fives, or two Queens) is on top of the central pile, the entire central pile is added to the player’s hand, and their hand is shuffled automatically.

Sandwich - If (two cards of the same number - such as two Aces, or two Fives, or two Queens, separated by a different card in the middle) is on top of the central pile, the entire central pile is added to the player’s hand, and their hand is shuffled automatically.

If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a jack, they must give one card, face down, to the player of that card. When a player has no more cards left, they remain in the game until the next jack is turned. The player may slap at the jack in an effort to get a new pile. If the player fails to win that next pile, they lose.
